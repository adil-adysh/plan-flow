# ðŸ§ª TaskScheduler Integration Test Plan

This test plan covers **integration scenarios** for the `TaskScheduler` and its interaction with other core modules, focusing on end-to-end scheduling, recurrence, and retry workflows.

## âœ… Test Case Matrix

| Test Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `test_schedule_new_task_occurrence` | Schedules a new task occurrence and verifies correct slot assignment. |
| `test_recurrence_creates_next_occurrence` | Confirms that recurring tasks generate the next occurrence as expected. |
| `test_retry_logic_triggers_reschedule` | Ensures retry policy triggers a new occurrence when a task is missed. |
| `test_slot_and_working_hours_enforced` | Validates that scheduling respects slot pool and working hours. |
| `test_max_per_day_limit_enforced` | Ensures daily task cap is not exceeded during scheduling. |
| `test_pinned_time_handling` | Verifies that pinned times are respected or rejected based on constraints. |
| `test_integration_with_calendar_planner` | Confirms that CalendarPlanner is used for slot validation. |
| `test_integration_with_execution_repository` | Ensures scheduled occurrences are persisted and retrieved correctly. |
