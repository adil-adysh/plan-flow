# PlanFlow: Accessible Task Scheduling for NVDA (In Development)

**PlanFlow** is an NVDA add-on designed to help you schedule, track, and manage your daily tasks in an accessible way. The project is under active development—some features are available now, and many more are planned.

> **Note for Users:** There is currently no user interface. All features are accessible only via Python code or scripts. If you are an end user, you may want to follow the project for updates as we work toward a full, user-friendly experience.

## What Can PlanFlow Do Right Now?

- **Add and Store Tasks:** Create tasks with a title, description, and scheduled time (using code).
- **Recurring Tasks:** Set up tasks to repeat on a regular schedule (e.g., daily, weekly).
- **Time Slots and Working Hours:** Define your preferred time slots (like “morning” or “evening”) and set your working hours for each day.
- **Daily Task Limits:** Limit how many tasks can be scheduled per day.
- **Mark Tasks as Done:** Mark tasks as done and keep a history of completions.
- **Automatic Handling of Missed Tasks:** Missed tasks can be automatically rescheduled according to your preferences and limits.
- **Local Storage:** All your data is stored locally on your computer. Nothing is sent online.

## What’s Coming Next?

- **User Interface:** A simple, accessible interface for managing your tasks directly from NVDA.
- **Notifications and Reminders:** Get notified when tasks are due or missed.
- **Settings and Customization:** More options for customizing your experience.
- **Better Documentation:** Step-by-step guides and help resources.
